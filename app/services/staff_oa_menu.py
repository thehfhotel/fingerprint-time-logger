"""Employee Hub Role Menus — the grant-driven rich-menu model (2026-07).

The Employee Hub is the rich menu on the dedicated staff LINE Official
Account (ADR: HF-erp docs/adr/0001-employee-hub-is-line-rich-menu.md).
Buttons appear per app grant (``employee_app_grants``); since the Hub was
narrowed to a pure MAID tool (owner, 2026-08-14) there are no ungated base
buttons left at all, so the ``base`` variant is EMPTY and an employee
without the ``housekeeping`` grant gets no menu — see the comment at the
top of MENU_BUTTONS. This module is the single source of truth for which
buttons exist, which grant reveals each one, and how a grant set maps to a
rich-menu layout — everything else (image rendering, the LINE Messaging
API sync, the follow-event webhook) derives from it.

Pure functions only — no I/O, no LINE calls, no database. That keeps the
menu-computation logic trivially testable and reusable by both the sync
script and the webhook handler.

    # BASE IS DELIBERATELY EMPTY (owner directive 2026-08-14: "remove the
    # clock-in button too"). No MenuButton carries grant_app_id=None any
    # more, so `base` — the variant an employee with no menu-relevant grant
    # resolves to — has ZERO buttons, and that is the intended end state of
    # narrowing the Hub to a pure MAID tool: the only buttons left are the
    # two `housekeeping` ones below, so an employee WITHOUT that grant sees
    # no Employee Hub menu at all. Not a degraded menu, not a launcher with
    # one dead tile — nothing. That is the point: the Hub is for maids.
    #
    # This supersedes the old "keep สแกนเข้างาน because base must never be
    # empty" reasoning that lived here. The clock-in tile (glyph "clock") was
    # the last base button and it was kept partly to dodge a footgun rather
    # than on its own merits. Note what it actually SHIPPED as: the bare
    # https://erp.thehfhotel.org/qr-checkin, which 301s to http:// and then
    # 404s — dead on every linked employee's phone from the menu's first
    # commit (a816c86b, 2026-07-09) until it was removed on 2026-08-14. If a
    # clock-in tile ever returns, the correct target is
    # https://erp.thehfhotel.org/qr-checkin/mobile; see the "If a clock-in
    # button ever comes back" section of docs/EMPLOYEE_HUB_SETUP.md. The footgun is now handled head-on instead of
    # papered over with a button: scripts/staff_oa_sync.py computes
    # `base_has_buttons` once, up front, and branches on it — see sync() in
    # that file. When base is empty the sync deploys NO base menu, CLEARS
    # the channel default (rather than leaving it pointed at a menu the
    # stale-menu sweep is about to delete), and UNLINKS the employees whose
    # variant is `base` instead of linking them to a menu that no longer
    # exists. app/services/staff_oa_service.link_role_menu_for_line_user()
    # (the follow-webhook path) degrades the same way: no buttons ⇒ no menu
    # ⇒ return None, never a link to someone else's variant.
    #
    # Consequence to keep in mind before re-adding a base button: with base
    # empty, menu_size(0) still raises, so menu_signature / rich_menu_name /
    # rich_menu_payload cannot be called for the empty grant set at all.
    # That is deliberate — there is no LINE menu to name or render — and the
    # sync never calls them for base because it never plans that variant.
    #
    # Re-adding clock-in (or any other base tile) is a one-line change here;
    # the empty-base handling downstream is written to survive both states,
    # and tests pin both (tests/unit/test_staff_oa_sync.py runs the whole
    # sync against a synthetic base button as well as against the real,
    # empty base).
    #
    # Reimbursement is deliberately NOT on the menu (owner directive
    # 2026-08-14). The button opened reimbursement.thehfhotel.org inside
    # LINE's in-app browser, where Google refuses OAuth entirely
    # (disallowed_useragent) — managers reaching the Cloudflare Access
    # picker were dead-ended, which read as "reimbursement is LINE-only".
    # Reimbursement is a web app used from real browsers (desktop included);
    # don't re-add it here without solving the external-browser handoff.
    #
    # เงินเดือน (payroll) and OTA Desk were removed the same day, for scope
    # rather than breakage: the owner set the Hub's purpose as a MAID tool
    # ("notify reception of cleaning progress and maid inventory"), and
    # neither is a maid tool. Both are also dual-IdP with a Cloudflare picker,
    # so they render a Google button inside LINE — the same shape that
    # dead-ended Reimbursement. It bites less there because both are
    # grant-gated to HF ID (LINE) employees, who pick HF ID and get through;
    # it is a footgun, not a live outage. Removing the tiles removes only the
    # launcher — the grants still open both from a real browser, where they
    # work better. Nobody held the `ota` grant at all.
    #
    # แม่บ้าน (hotel.thehfhotel.org/hk) — RE-ADDED 2026-08-14 on the owner's
    # explicit go, after being deferred earlier the same day ("report clean
    # rooms defer"). Both conditions recorded at deferral were addressed by the
    # wave-4 stream in new-hotel: `?branch=` is now REQUIRED on every /hk room
    # endpoint (400 absent, 403 outside the HK_BRANCHES allowlist) instead of
    # silently defaulting to Branch::Hfhotel, and a maid mark-dirty verb now
    # exists. The immediate reason for the re-add is that V11 — a maid walking
    # start -> done on a real room — is meant to be exercised FROM this tile
    # rather than by typing the URL.
    #
    # TWO CAVEATS THAT ARE STILL OPEN, and they matter before other maids get
    # the `housekeeping` grant:
    #   1. The branch is PICKED BY THE MAID (a per-device picker whose options
    #      come from the global HK_BRANCHES env), not derived from her identity.
    #      A HF Ville maid can still choose HF Hotel and file against the wrong
    #      property. A per-employee guard keyed on HF ID's Employee.location is
    #      being built to close this; until it lands, the picker is the only
    #      thing standing between a mis-tap and a wrong-property write.
    #   2. Nothing notifies reception of anything. A maid's report reaches a
    #      30-second-poll board and no human — ht_hk_cleaning_events is read by
    #      nothing outside routes/hk.rs, so `started` has zero reception
    #      visibility, and only `done` lands, as a silent room_clean flip.
    #
    # Today the exposure of both is bounded: badge 421 (the owner) is the sole
    # `housekeeping` grant holder, so this tile reaches exactly one person who
    # knows the caveats. Re-check both before granting a real maid.
    #
    # Housekeeping Ops (docs/housekeeping-ops-interfaces.md, 2026-08-11): the
    # ~/HF/housekeeping app's maid-facing pages, revealed by the same
    # `housekeeping` grant. These two work end-to-end today.

    # WHY reception gets a tile at all: caveat 2 above ("nothing notifies

    # maid's `started` reached a 30-second-poll board and no human; reception
    # now has that board one tap away on the same phone they already carry the
    # Hub on, instead of a URL nobody typed.
    #
    # WHY it is safe to point reception at a write surface: it is not one for
    # them. new-hotel's hk_access middleware admits EITHER grant, but the
    # `reception` grant is a READ-ONLY viewer — the write verbs (POST
    # .../cleaning, POST .../linen-shortage) require `housekeeping` and answer
    # a reception-only identity with a 403. The /hk UI hides the reporting
    # controls for them (GET /api/hk/me returns canReport:false), but that is
    # UX: the server is the enforcement, and the tile is safe even if the
    # frontend regresses. An employee holding BOTH grants is full-access and
    # simply sees six tiles, the first and fifth pointing at the same board.
    #
    # This takes the both-grants variant to FIVE buttons — the 3+2 layout,
    # first real use of menu_rows(5). LINE's cap is 6, so exactly one tile of
    # headroom was left at this point; รายงานแม่บ้าน below spent it.

    # (decisions grilled 2026-09-02; vocabulary in new-hotel CONTEXT.md
    # §Housekeeping "Room report" / "Report verification").
    #
    # WHY IT IS ON THE MENU AT ALL: it is the maid's daily obligation, once per
    # room — status code, the equipment checklist, and her photos — and it
    # replaces a paper sheet she used to carry. A tool she must reach in every
    # room of her round is exactly what the Hub is for; the alternative is a
    # URL nobody types, which is what the /hk board was before it got a tile.
    #
    # WHY BOTH GRANTS REVEAL IT — the first shared tile on this menu. A report
    # is TWO-SIDED by design: the maid fills it (status, exceptions, 1-4
    # photos), and any receptionist of the branch countersigns it with 1-4
    # photos of her OWN — a verify is a walk-up, not a desk stamp — or returns
    # it with a canned reason for the maid to file a fresh report against. Both
    # halves live on the SAME screen (the day overview at /hk/report, the heir
    # of the paper day-sheet and each side's work queue), so a maid-only tile
    # would leave reception with no way in, and a second reception-only tile
    # pointing at the same URL would be a second row here — and would then show
    # TWICE for the owner, who holds both grants. Hence also_grant_app_ids: one
    # row, revealed by either grant, rendered once. See the MenuButton
    # docstring.
    #
    # WHY THAT IS SAFE: the tile is a launcher, not an authorization. new-hotel
    # enforces the roles SERVER-side on every verb — POST /api/hk/rooms/{id}
    # /report is maid-only (the can_report=true side), verify/return are
    # reception-only, and a maid who also holds `reception` still cannot verify
    # (she is the maid side). The /hk/report UI hides the other side's
    # controls, but that is UX; the server is the enforcement, and this tile
    # stays correct even if the frontend regresses. Same argument the
    # สถานะห้อง tile above already rests on.
    #
    # LINE'S CAP IS NOW EXACTLY REACHED: the both-grants variant is SIX buttons
    # (3+3, the last layout menu_rows() has). There is no headroom left. A
    # seventh tool cannot be a seventh row — it needs a tile removed, or two
    # tools merged behind one tile, or a launcher screen. The over-cap guards
    # in scripts/staff_oa_sync.py and app/services/staff_oa_provision.py are no
    # longer theoretical insurance: one more row here and the both-grants
